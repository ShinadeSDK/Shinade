What is Shinade?
Shinade is a privacy-native finance layer built on Solana. It operates as a high-speed, non-custodial privacy infrastructure where users maintain full ownership of their wallets while all financial actions flow through an encrypted shadow balance that conceals activity details from on-chain observers.

In the world of decentralized finance, every transaction is public by default. This transparency, while valuable for trustlessness, creates significant vulnerabilities: front-running bots, copycat traders, portfolio exposure, and strategic leakage. Shinade exists to solve this fundamental problem.

Unlike traditional privacy solutions that rely on mixers or complex multi-party computation, Shinade implements a novel Shadow Vault architecture. Your assets move into a private sub-account where subsequent actions—swaps, trades, yield strategies, portfolio adjustments—become invisible to direct blockchain tracing.

This is not privacy by policy. This is privacy by design. Enforced by cryptography. Guaranteed by architecture.
